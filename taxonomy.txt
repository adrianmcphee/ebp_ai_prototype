  Core Principle: The Certainty Gradient

  Natural Language → Probabilistic Understanding → Deterministic Action
          ↓                    ↓                         ↓
     (Ambiguous)         (Confidence %)            (Executed)

  1. INTENT TRINITY

  1.1 Understanding Layer
  - Classification: What does the user want? (36 intents)
  - Confidence: How sure are we? (0.0 - 1.0)
  - Risk: What could go wrong? (LOW → CRITICAL)

  1.2 Decision Point
  Confidence > 0.85 → Execute with confirmation
  Confidence 0.6-0.85 → Disambiguate choices
  Confidence < 0.6 → Request clarification

  1.3 The Banking Intent Formula
  Intent = Category + Action + Risk Level + Auth Requirement

  ---
  2. ENTITY INTELLIGENCE

  2.1 The Extraction Hierarchy
  Required Entities → Must have to proceed
  Optional Entities → Enhance if present
  Inferred Entities → Derive from context

  2.2 Validation Cascade
  1. Format Check (Is it valid?)
  2. Business Rule (Is it allowed?)
  3. Risk Assessment (Is it safe?)

  ---
  3. CONVERSATION MEMORY

  3.1 Context Stack (What to Remember)
  - Last 3: Intent, Amount, Recipient
  - Pending: Action awaiting completion
  - References: Pronouns and relations

  3.2 Resolution Rules
  - "him/her" → last_recipient
  - "same amount" → last_amount
  - "there" → last_account
  - "again" → repeat last_action

  ---
  4. THE CERTAINTY BRIDGE

  4.1 Probabilistic Inputs
  - Natural language queries
  - Partial information
  - Ambiguous references
  - Colloquial expressions

  4.2 Transformation Mechanisms
  - Confidence Scoring: Quantify uncertainty
  - Disambiguation UI: Resolve ambiguity
  - Progressive Disclosure: Gather missing info
  - Explicit Confirmation: Lock in decision

  4.3 Deterministic Outputs
  - Executed transactions
  - Audit logs
  - Compliance records
  - System state changes

  5. RISK-ADAPTIVE SECURITY

  Operation Risk → Authentication Level → User Action Required
       LOW      →      BASIC           →     View only
      MEDIUM    →      FULL            →     Password
       HIGH     →    CHALLENGE         →     MFA + Confirm
     CRITICAL   →    MULTI-STEP        →     MFA + Wait + Confirm

  ---
  6. THE FEEDBACK LOOP

  6.1 Learning Points
  - Failed intents → Pattern updates
  - Disambiguations → Confidence adjustments
  - Confirmations → Threshold tuning

  6.2 Quality Signals
  - Time to resolution
  - Number of turns
  - Confidence progression
  - Execution success rate

  ---
  7. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE LAYER

  7.1 The Audit Triangle
  User Input → System Decision → Action Taken
       ↓             ↓                ↓
    Recorded    Confidence Log    Transaction ID

  7.2 Compliance Rules
  - Minimum confidence for financial operations: 0.85
  - Maximum automation for amounts > $10,000: NONE
  - Required human confirmation for: Account closure, Large transfers, New payees

  ---
  8. THE SIMPLICITY PARADOX

  Complex Inside, Simple Outside
  - User sees: Natural conversation
  - System does: 50+ validation checks
  - Regulator sees: Complete audit trail
  - Developer sees: Modular components

  ---
  The Essential Formula

  Conversational Banking =
      (Intent + Entities + Context) × Confidence
      ÷ Risk
      + Human Confirmation
      = Deterministic Action

  Key Insights

  1. The 3-Layer Architecture

  Layer 1: Language Understanding (AI/ML)
  Layer 2: Business Logic (Rules)
  Layer 3: Execution (Deterministic)

  2. The 4 States of Certainty

  1. UNCERTAIN: "I think you want..."
  2. PROBABLE: "Did you mean..."
  3. CONFIDENT: "I'll do this..."
  4. EXECUTED: "Done."

  3. The 5 Conversation Patterns

  1. Single-turn completion
  2. Clarification request
  3. Disambiguation choice
  4. Progressive collection
  5. Confirmation & execute

  Key Gaps to Address

  1. Disambiguation UI

  Currently limited to:
  // Only handles recipient disambiguation
  setDisambiguationOptions(data.disambiguations.recipient);
  Needs expansion for accounts, dates, amounts.

  2. Authentication Flow

  Defined but not enforced:
  auth_required=AuthLevel.FULL  # Defined in intent
  # But no actual auth check in pipeline execution

  3. Confirmation UX

  Backend ready:
  "requires_confirmation": true
  But UI only shows text, needs actual confirm/cancel buttons.

  4. Error Recovery

  No handling for:
  - Network failures
  - LLM timeouts
  - Invalid entity combinations
  - Business rule violations

  The Ultimate Test

  A conversational banking system succeeds when:

  1. Grandma can use it (Simplicity)
  2. Regulators approve it (Compliance)
  3. Hackers can't exploit it (Security)
  4. Banks can trust it (Reliability)
  5. Developers can extend it (Modularity)
