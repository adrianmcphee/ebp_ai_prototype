## **üé≠ DEMO SCENARIOS TO PROVE**

### **Scenario A: Navigation Assistance**
```
User: "Take me to international transfers"
System: "Routing you to international wire transfers."
[Opens existing wire transfer screen at /banking/transfers/international]
System: "You're now on the international transfer page. This form handles all international wire transfers."
```

### **Scenario B: Transaction Assistance** 
```
User: "Send $500 to my friend in Canada"
System: "Building a custom transfer form for this transaction."
[Generates 4-field form: Friend's Name, Bank, Account Number, Amount ($500 pre-filled)]
System: "This streamlined form has everything you need for a Canadian transfer."
User: [Fills out John Smith, TD Bank, 123456789]
System: "Transfer ready. $500 to John Smith at TD Bank. Confirm?"
```

### **Scenario C: MCP Integration**
```
Claude Desktop: "Check my account balance and then transfer $200 to my savings"
[Via MCP tools: get_account_balance() ‚Üí transfer_funds()]
System: "Checking balance... $2,150 available. Transferring $200 to savings..."
Claude Desktop: "Transfer complete. New checking balance: $1,950"
```

### **Scenario D: Navigation vs Transaction Comparison**
```
Navigation Intent: "Take me to bill pay" 
‚Üí Routes to existing /banking/payments/bills interface (pre-built form)

Transaction Intent: "Pay my electricity bill"
‚Üí Builds custom PG&E payment form with smart company lookup and amount suggestions
```

### **Scenario C: Multi-turn Conversation**
```
User: "I want to pay my rent"
System: "How much is your rent?"
User: "$1500"
System: "Which account should I use?"
User: "Checking"
System: "I'll pay $1500 rent from checking. Confirm?"
```

### **Scenario D: Claude Desktop Integration**
```
User in Claude: "Check my bank balance"
Claude via MCP: Connects to EBP, retrieves balance
Claude: Shows balance + offers follow-up actions
```
