### **1.3 Enhanced Intent-to-Action Pipeline**
- [x] **Create Banking Operations Catalog** ‚úÖ
- [x] **Integrate operations catalog into pipeline** ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Fix intent processing flow** (Current issue: 0.0 confidence in API)
  - [ ] Debug why API returns 0.0 confidence while direct test returns 0.697
  - [ ] Check entity extraction in full pipeline vs direct test

  - [ ] Guide users through multi-step processes
  - [ ] Provide contextual help for each screen

### **2.3 Frontend Navigation Integration**

  - [ ] Add screen/section routing
  - [ ] Implement guided navigation flows
  - [ ] Create breadcrumb navigation
  - [ ] Add contextual help overlays

---

## **PHASE 3: CONVERSATION INTELLIGENCE** üß†

### **3.1 Enhanced Disambiguation**
- [ ] **Expand disambiguation beyond recipients** (Currently ‚ö†Ô∏è partial)
  - [ ] Account disambiguation ("which account?")
  - [ ] Amount disambiguation ("how much?") 
  - [ ] Date/time disambiguation ("when?")
  - [ ] Action disambiguation ("did you mean transfer or pay?")

### **3.2 Progressive Information Collection**
- [ ] **Multi-turn conversation flows**
  - [ ] Missing entity collection workflows

  - [ ] Enhanced pronoun resolution ("transfer it there again")
  - [ ] Cross-session memory persistence
  - [ ] User preference learning
  - [ ] Conversation history search

---

## **PHASE 4: SECURITY & VALIDATION** üîê

### **4.1 Authentication Flow Implementation**
- [ ] **Risk-based authentication** (Currently ‚ö†Ô∏è defined but not enforced)
  - [ ] LOW risk: View-only operations
  - [ ] MEDIUM risk: Password confirmation
  - [ ] HIGH risk: MFA + explicit confirmation
  - [ ] CRITICAL risk: Multi-step approval process

### **4.2 Confirmation & Approval Workflows**
- [ ] **Enhanced confirmation UI** (Currently ‚ö†Ô∏è partial)
  - [ ] Confirm/cancel buttons for transactions
  - [ ] Transaction preview screens
  - [ ] Risk level indicators
  - [ ] Explicit approval workflows

### **4.3 Business Rule Validation**
- [ ] **Comprehensive validation system**
  - [ ] Account balance checks
  - [ ] Transfer limits validation
  - [ ] Recipient verification
  - [ ] Fraud detection rules

---

## **PHASE 5: ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ

### **5.1 Error Recovery System**
- [ ] **Robust error handling** (Currently missing)
  - [ ] Network failure recovery
  - [ ] LLM timeout handling
  - [ ] Invalid entity combination errors
  - [ ] Business rule violation recovery

### **5.2 Fallback Mechanisms**
- [ ] **Graceful degradation**
  - [ ] Fallback to simpler operations
  - [ ] Human handoff triggers
  - [ ] Alternative action suggestions
  - [ ] Error explanation & guidance

---

## **PHASE 6: TESTING & VALIDATION** üß™

### **6.1 End-to-End Test Completion**
- [ ] **Fix Playwright test suite**
  - [ ] Resolve intent processing for test queries
  - [ ] Add comprehensive test scenarios
  - [ ] Test all 34 intent types
  - [ ] Validate MCP tool integration

### **6.2 Demo Scenarios**
- [ ] **Create complete demo flows**
  - [ ] Balance inquiry with navigation
  - [ ] Multi-step transfer with confirmation
  - [ ] Bill payment with recipient management
  - [ ] Card blocking with security validation

## **üé≠ DEMO SCENARIOS TO PROVE**

### **Scenario A: Intelligent Banking Operations**
```
User: "What's my checking account balance?"
System: Shows balance, offers related actions
User: "Transfer $500 to John"
System: Finds John, confirms transfer, executes
```

### **Scenario B: Navigation Assistance** 
```
User: "I need to pay my electricity bill"
System: "I'll take you to bill pay. Is this a one-time payment or do you want to set up autopay?"
User: "Just once for now"
System: "Opening bill pay. I can help you find your utility company - what's the name?"
User: "PG&E" 
System: "Found Pacific Gas & Electric. I'll pre-fill their details for you."
```

### **Scenario B2: Complex Navigation (International Transfer)**
```
User: "I want to send money to my daughter at college"
System: "Is she at a US college or international?"
User: "University of Toronto"
System: "That's international - I'll guide you through the wire transfer process."
System: "You'll need her Canadian bank details. Let me walk you through this step by step."
[Navigates to international transfers with contextual help]
```

### **Scenario C: Multi-turn Conversation**
```
User: "I want to pay my rent"
System: "How much is your rent?"
User: "$1500"

System: "I'll pay $1500 rent from checking. Confirm?"
```

### **Scenario D: Claude Desktop Integration**
```
User in Claude: "Check my bank balance"
Claude via MCP: Connects to EBP, retrieves balance
Claude: Shows balance + offers follow-up actions
```
