# EBP AI Banking - System Architecture

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW**

The EBP (Enterprise Banking Platform) AI system transforms natural language banking conversations into deterministic, auditable banking operations while maintaining regulatory compliance and user control.

### **Core Principle: The Certainty Gradient**

```
Natural Language ‚Üí Probabilistic Understanding ‚Üí Deterministic Action
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                         ‚Üì
  (Ambiguous)         (Confidence %)            (Executed)
```

The system bridges the gap between probabilistic AI understanding and the deterministic requirements of financial services.

## üß† **CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS**

### **1. Intent Classification**
**What it is**: The system's ability to understand what a user wants to do from natural language.

**How it works**: 
- **Probabilistic Layer**: AI analyzes user queries and assigns confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- **Pattern Matching**: Fallback rules ensure reliability when AI confidence is low
- **Risk Assessment**: Each intent has an associated risk level (LOW ‚Üí CRITICAL)

**Why it matters**: Banks need to understand customer intent reliably before executing financial operations.

```python
# Example: "What's my balance?" ‚Üí 
{
  "intent_id": "accounts.balance.check",
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "risk_level": "LOW"
}
```

### **2. Confidence Scoring**
**What it is**: A numerical measure (0.0-1.0) of how certain the system is about understanding user intent.

**Decision Thresholds**:
- **> 0.85**: Execute with confirmation
- **0.6-0.85**: Disambiguate choices  
- **< 0.6**: Request clarification

**The 4 States of Certainty**:
1. **UNCERTAIN**: "I think you want..." (< 0.6)
2. **PROBABLE**: "Did you mean..." (0.6-0.85)
3. **CONFIDENT**: "I'll do this..." (> 0.85)
4. **EXECUTED**: "Done." (Action completed)

**Why it matters**: Financial operations require high certainty. Low confidence triggers human intervention.

### **3. Entity Extraction**
**What it is**: Identifying specific pieces of information needed to complete banking operations.

**Types**:
- **Required Entities**: Must have to proceed (e.g., amount for transfers)
- **Optional Entities**: Enhance if present (e.g., memo for payments)
- **Inferred Entities**: Derived from context (e.g., "checking" as default account)

**Example**:
```
Query: "Send $500 to John from my savings"
Entities: {
  "amount": 500,
  "recipient": "John", 
  "from_account": "savings"
}
```

### **4. Conversation Memory & Context**
**What it is**: The system's ability to remember previous interactions and resolve references.

**Context Types**:
- **Session Context**: Current conversation state
- **Customer Context**: Long-term user preferences and history
- **Reference Resolution**: Understanding "it", "there", "same amount", etc.

**Why it's crucial**: Natural conversations reference previous statements. "Transfer it there again" must be understood.

**Resolution Rules**:
- "him/her" ‚Üí last_recipient
- "same amount" ‚Üí last_amount  
- "there" ‚Üí last_account
- "again" ‚Üí repeat last_action

## üìÅ **SYSTEM CATALOGS**

### **1. Intent Catalog (34 Banking Intents)**
**Purpose**: Defines all possible banking operations the system can understand.

**Structure**:
```python
BankingIntent(
    intent_id="accounts.balance.check",
    name="Check Account Balance",
    category=IntentCategory.ACCOUNT_MANAGEMENT,
    risk_level=RiskLevel.LOW,
    auth_required=AuthLevel.BASIC,
    required_entities=["account_type"],
    keywords=["balance", "how much", "available funds"]
)
```

**Categories**:
- Account Management (9 intents)
- Payments & Transfers (8 intents) 
- Card Services (6 intents)
- Support & Inquiries (7 intents)
- System Navigation (4 intents)

### **2. Banking Operations Catalog**
**Purpose**: Maps intents to concrete banking operations with business rules.

**Structure**:
```python
BankingOperation(
    operation_id="check_balance",
    name="Check Account Balance",
    type=OperationType.READ_ONLY,
    required_entities=["account_type"],
    business_rules=["account_must_exist", "user_must_own_account"],
    risk_level=RiskLevel.LOW,
    execution_handler=_execute_balance_check
)
```

**Operation Types**:
- **READ_ONLY**: View information (low risk)
- **TRANSACTIONAL**: Move money (medium-high risk)
- **ADMINISTRATIVE**: Account management (medium-high risk)
- **NAVIGATIONAL**: UI guidance (low risk)

### **3. UI Screen Catalog** *(Phase 2 - In Development)*
**Purpose**: Maps banking operations to UI screens for navigation assistance.

**Concept**:
```python
UIScreen(
    screen_id="transfer_screen",
    name="Money Transfer",
    related_intents=["payments.transfer.internal", "payments.transfer.external"],
    navigation_path="/transfers",
    help_content="Guide users through transfer process"
)
```

**Benefits Even Without AI**:
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Contextual help system
- User journey mapping
- A/B testing framework

## üîÑ **THE PROCESSING PIPELINE**

### **Pipeline Flow**
```
1. Natural Language Input
   ‚Üì
2. Intent Classification (Probabilistic)
   ‚Üì  
3. Entity Extraction (Probabilistic)
   ‚Üì
4. Confidence Evaluation (Deterministic Rules)
   ‚Üì
5. Business Rule Validation (Deterministic)
   ‚Üì

## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY & RISK MANAGEMENT**

### **Risk-Adaptive Authentication**
```
Operation Risk ‚Üí Authentication Level ‚Üí User Action Required
     LOW      ‚Üí      BASIC           ‚Üí     View only
    MEDIUM    ‚Üí      FULL            ‚Üí     Password  
     HIGH     ‚Üí    CHALLENGE         ‚Üí     MFA + Confirm
   CRITICAL   ‚Üí    MULTI-STEP        ‚Üí     MFA + Wait + Confirm
```

### **Audit Trail Components**
- **User Input**: Original natural language query
- **AI Decision**: Intent classification with confidence scores
- **System Decision**: Business rules applied and results
- **Action Taken**: Executed operation with reference ID
- **Compliance Record**: Complete audit chain for regulators

**The Audit Triangle**:
```
User Input ‚Üí System Decision ‚Üí Action Taken
     ‚Üì             ‚Üì                ‚Üì
  Recorded    Confidence Log    Transaction ID
```

**Compliance Rules**:
- Minimum confidence for financial operations: 0.85
- Maximum automation for amounts > $10,000: NONE
- Required human confirmation for: Account closure, Large transfers, New payees

## üèõÔ∏è **BANKING-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Multi-Turn Conversation Handling**
Banks need to handle complex, multi-step processes:
```
User: "I want to pay my rent"
System: "How much is your rent?"
User: "$1500" 
System: "Which account should I use?"
User: "Checking"
System: "I'll pay $1500 rent from checking. Confirm?"
```

**The 5 Conversation Patterns**:
1. **Single-turn completion** - "What's my balance?" ‚Üí Answer
2. **Clarification request** - "Transfer money" ‚Üí "How much?"
3. **Disambiguation choice** - "Pay John" ‚Üí "Which John?"
4. **Progressive collection** - Gather missing entities step by step
5. **Confirmation & execute** - "Transfer $500 to John from checking. Confirm?"

### **Context Preservation**
Banking conversations often reference previous actions:
- "Transfer the same amount to Sarah"
- "Block that card I mentioned earlier"
- "Add him as a payee too"

### **Error Recovery & Fallback**
Financial services require robust error handling:
- Network failures during transactions
- LLM timeouts or unavailability  
- Invalid entity combinations
- Business rule violations

## üîÆ **KEY ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES**

### **The Essential Formula**
```
Conversational Banking = 
    (Intent + Entities + Context) √ó Confidence
    √∑ Risk
    + Human Confirmation
    = Deterministic Action
```

### **The Banking Intent Formula**
```
Intent = Category + Action + Risk Level + Auth Requirement
```

### **The Simplicity Paradox**
**Complex Inside, Simple Outside**
- **User sees**: Natural conversation
- **System does**: 50+ validation checks  
- **Regulator sees**: Complete audit trail
- **Developer sees**: Modular components

### **Entity Validation Cascade**
1. **Format Check**: Is it valid?
2. **Business Rule**: Is it allowed?
3. **Risk Assessment**: Is it safe?
