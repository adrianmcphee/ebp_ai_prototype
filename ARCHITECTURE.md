# EBP AI Banking - System Architecture

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW**

The EBP (Enterprise Banking Platform) AI system transforms natural language banking conversations into deterministic, auditable banking operations while maintaining regulatory compliance and user control.

### **Core Principle: The Certainty Gradient**

```
Natural Language ‚Üí Probabilistic Understanding ‚Üí Deterministic Action
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                         ‚Üì
  (Ambiguous)         (Confidence %)            (Executed)
```

The system bridges the gap between probabilistic AI understanding and the deterministic requirements of financial services.

## üß† **CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS**

### **1. Intent Classification**
**What it is**: The system's ability to understand what a user wants to do from natural language.

**How it works**: 
- **Probabilistic Layer**: AI analyzes user queries and assigns confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- **Pattern Matching**: Fallback rules ensure reliability when AI confidence is low
- **Risk Assessment**: Each intent has an associated risk level (LOW ‚Üí CRITICAL)

**Why it matters**: Banks need to understand customer intent reliably before executing financial operations.

```python
# Example: "What's my balance?" ‚Üí 
{
  "intent_id": "accounts.balance.check",
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "risk_level": "LOW"
}
```

### **2. Confidence Scoring**
**What it is**: A numerical measure (0.0-1.0) of how certain the system is about understanding user intent.

**Decision Thresholds**:
- **> 0.85**: Execute with confirmation
- **0.6-0.85**: Disambiguate choices  
- **< 0.6**: Request clarification

**The 4 States of Certainty**:
1. **UNCERTAIN**: "I think you want..." (< 0.6)
2. **PROBABLE**: "Did you mean..." (0.6-0.85)
3. **CONFIDENT**: "I'll do this..." (> 0.85)
4. **EXECUTED**: "Done." (Action completed)

**Why it matters**: Financial operations require high certainty. Low confidence triggers human intervention.

### **3. Entity Extraction**
**What it is**: Identifying specific pieces of information needed to complete banking operations.

**Types**:
- **Required Entities**: Must have to proceed (e.g., amount for transfers)
- **Optional Entities**: Enhance if present (e.g., memo for payments)
- **Inferred Entities**: Derived from context (e.g., "checking" as default account)

**Example**:
```
Query: "Send $500 to John from my savings"
Entities: {
  "amount": 500,
  "recipient": "John", 
  "from_account": "savings"
}
```

### **4. Conversation Memory & Context**
**What it is**: The system's ability to remember previous interactions and resolve references.

**Context Types**:
- **Session Context**: Current conversation state
- **Customer Context**: Long-term user preferences and history
- **Reference Resolution**: Understanding "it", "there", "same amount", etc.

**Why it's crucial**: Natural conversations reference previous statements. "Transfer it there again" must be understood.

**Resolution Rules**:
- "him/her" ‚Üí last_recipient
- "same amount" ‚Üí last_amount  
- "there" ‚Üí last_account
- "again" ‚Üí repeat last_action

## üìÅ **SYSTEM CATALOGS**

### **1. Intent Catalog (34 Banking Intents)**
**Purpose**: Defines all possible banking operations the system can understand.

**Structure**:
```python
BankingIntent(
    intent_id="accounts.balance.check",
    name="Check Account Balance",
    category=IntentCategory.ACCOUNT_MANAGEMENT,
    risk_level=RiskLevel.LOW,
    auth_required=AuthLevel.BASIC,
    required_entities=["account_type"],
    keywords=["balance", "how much", "available funds"]
)
```

**Categories**:
- Account Management (9 intents)
- Payments & Transfers (8 intents) 
- Card Services (6 intents)
- Support & Inquiries (7 intents)
- System Navigation (4 intents)

### **2. Banking Operations Catalog**
**Purpose**: Maps intents to concrete banking operations with business rules.

**Structure**:
```python
BankingOperation(
    operation_id="check_balance",
    name="Check Account Balance",
    type=OperationType.READ_ONLY,
    required_entities=["account_type"],
    business_rules=["account_must_exist", "user_must_own_account"],
    risk_level=RiskLevel.LOW,
    execution_handler=_execute_balance_check
)
```

**Operation Types**:
- **READ_ONLY**: View information (low risk)
- **TRANSACTIONAL**: Move money (medium-high risk)
- **ADMINISTRATIVE**: Account management (medium-high risk)
- **NAVIGATIONAL**: UI guidance (low risk)

### **3. UI Screen Catalog** *(Phase 2 - In Development)*
**Purpose**: Maps banking operations to UI screens for navigation assistance.

**The Navigation Problem**: Traditional banking UIs are like being in an unfamiliar supermarket where items are organized by the bank's internal logic rather than how customers think.

**Traditional Banking UI**:
```
Customer thinks: "I want to send money to my friend"
Bank UI organizing: Products ‚Üí Transfers ‚Üí International ‚Üí Wire Transfer ‚Üí Setup Form
Customer gets lost: "Where's international? Is this a wire? What's SWIFT?"
```

**AI-Powered Navigation**:
```
Customer says: "Send money to my friend in Canada"
AI understands: Intent + context + complexity
System responds: "I'll guide you to international transfers and help with the details"
```

**Concept**:
```python
UIScreen(
    screen_id="transfer_screen",
    name="Money Transfer",
    related_intents=["payments.transfer.internal", "payments.transfer.external"],
    navigation_path="/transfers",
    help_content="Guide users through transfer process",
    customer_language=["send money", "pay someone", "transfer funds"],
    bank_terminology=["Wire Transfer", "ACH", "International Remittance"]
)
```

**The Supermarket Analogy**:
- **Traditional Bank**: Items organized by bank departments (like putting all beans together)
- **Customer-Centric AI**: Items organized by customer intent (Mexican section, Italian section)
- **Smart Navigation**: "Looking for taco ingredients? Let me show you where everything is"

**Benefits**:
- **Natural Language Access**: "Pay my rent" ‚Üí Direct to bill pay setup
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Knows if you've done this before, suggests shortcuts
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Shows only relevant options based on your situation
- **Cross-Channel Consistency**: Same logic works on web, mobile, voice
- **Reduced Support Calls**: Self-service with intelligent guidance

## üîÑ **THE PROCESSING PIPELINE**

### **Pipeline Flow**
```
1. Natural Language Input
   ‚Üì
2. Intent Classification (Probabilistic)
   ‚Üì  
3. Entity Extraction (Probabilistic)
   ‚Üì
4. Confidence Evaluation (Deterministic Rules)
   ‚Üì
5. Business Rule Validation (Deterministic)
   ‚Üì
6. Banking Operation Execution (Deterministic)
   ‚Üì
7. Audit Logging (Deterministic)
```

### **Layer-by-Layer Example: "Transfer $500 to my mom"**

Let's trace this query through each layer to see exactly what happens:

#### **Layer 1: Language Understanding (Probabilistic)**
**Input**: "Transfer $500 to my mom"

**Intent Classification**:
- AI analyzes: "transfer" = payment intent
- Confidence: 0.92 (high confidence)
- Result: `payments.transfer.external`

**Entity Extraction**:
- AI identifies: "$500" = amount
- AI identifies: "my mom" = recipient
- Missing: from_account (needs clarification)
- Result: `{amount: 500, recipient: "my mom", from_account: null}`

#### **Layer 2: Business Logic (Deterministic Rules)**
**Confidence Evaluation**:
```python
if confidence >= 0.85:  # 0.92 > 0.85
    proceed_to_validation()
else:
    request_clarification()
```

**Business Rule Validation**:
```python
# Rule 1: Amount validation
if amount > 10000:  # $500 < $10,000 ‚úì
    require_additional_auth()

# Rule 2: Recipient validation  
if recipient not in known_recipients:
    resolve_recipient("my mom")  # ‚Üí "Sarah Johnson"

# Rule 3: Account validation
if from_account is None:
    default_to_primary_account()  # ‚Üí "checking"

# Rule 4: Balance check
if checking_balance < amount:  # $2,150 > $500 ‚úì
    reject_insufficient_funds()
```

#### **Layer 3: Execution (Deterministic)**
**Banking Operation**:
```python
transfer_result = banking_service.send_payment(
    recipient="Sarah Johnson",
    amount=500.00,
    from_account="checking"
)
# Result: {"success": True, "transaction_id": "TXN-123456"}
```

**Audit Logging**:
```python
audit_log = {
    "user_input": "Transfer $500 to my mom",
    "intent_confidence": 0.92,
    "business_rules_applied": ["amount_check", "recipient_resolution", "balance_validation"],
    "transaction_id": "TXN-123456",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### **Probabilistic vs Deterministic Components**

**Probabilistic (AI-Powered)**:
- Intent classification from natural language
- Entity extraction from unstructured text
- Context understanding and reference resolution
- Conversation flow management

**Deterministic (Rule-Based)**:
- Confidence threshold enforcement
- Business rule validation
- Authentication and authorization
- Banking operation execution
- Audit trail generation
- Risk assessment enforcement

### **Why This Hybrid Approach?**

#### **Alternative Architecture Comparison**

**‚ùå Fully Deterministic Approach (Traditional Banking)**
```
User Input ‚Üí Rule Parsing ‚Üí Fixed Logic ‚Üí Execution
```
**Problems**:
- "Send $500 to mom" ‚Üí ERROR: "mom" not recognized
- "Transfer five hundred dollars" ‚Üí ERROR: amount format invalid
- "Pay my rent" ‚Üí ERROR: payee "rent" not found
- **Result**: Frustrated users, high support costs

**‚ùå Fully Probabilistic Approach (Pure AI)**
```
User Input ‚Üí AI Decision ‚Üí AI Execution ‚Üí AI Logging
```
**Problems**:
- AI might interpret "$500" as "$5000" (hallucination)
- No consistent business rules enforcement
- Unpredictable behavior: same query, different results
- **Result**: Regulatory nightmare, potential fraud

**‚úÖ Hybrid Approach (Our Architecture)**
```
User Input ‚Üí AI Understanding ‚Üí Rule Validation ‚Üí Deterministic Execution
```
**Benefits**:
- "Send $500 to mom" ‚Üí AI resolves "mom" ‚Üí Rules validate ‚Üí Execute
- Consistent business logic across all transactions
- Explainable decisions for regulators
- **Result**: Natural UX + Banking reliability

#### **Real-World Failure Scenarios**

**What Happens When Layers Get It Wrong?**

**Scenario 1: AI Misunderstands Intent**
```
User: "Show me my balance"
AI: Interprets as "transfer.internal" (wrong!)
Confidence: 0.95 (high but wrong)
```
**Our Protection**: Business rules catch this because no amount/recipient entities were extracted for a transfer.

**Scenario 2: AI Extracts Wrong Amount**
```
User: "Transfer $50 to John"  
AI: Extracts amount as $500 (10x error)
```
**Our Protection**: Confirmation step shows "$500 to John - Confirm?" allowing user to catch the error.

**Scenario 3: Business Rules Fail**
```
User: "Transfer $50,000 to unknown recipient"
AI: Correctly classifies intent and extracts entities
Business Rules: Somehow miss the risk level
```
**Our Protection**: Multiple validation layers + audit trail allows investigation and system improvement.

**For Banks**:
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Deterministic components ensure auditability
- **Risk Management**: Clear rules for high-risk operations
- **Explainability**: Every decision can be traced and explained
- **Gradual Rollout**: Can adjust AI confidence thresholds based on performance

**For Customers**:
- **Natural Interaction**: AI handles language understanding
- **Predictable Behavior**: Clear rules for when actions execute
- **Trust**: Transparent decision-making process
- **Error Recovery**: Clear feedback when system needs clarification

## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY & RISK MANAGEMENT**

### **Risk-Adaptive Authentication**
```
Operation Risk ‚Üí Authentication Level ‚Üí User Action Required
     LOW      ‚Üí      BASIC           ‚Üí     View only
    MEDIUM    ‚Üí      FULL            ‚Üí     Password  
     HIGH     ‚Üí    CHALLENGE         ‚Üí     MFA + Confirm
   CRITICAL   ‚Üí    MULTI-STEP        ‚Üí     MFA + Wait + Confirm
```

### **Audit Trail Components**
- **User Input**: Original natural language query
- **AI Decision**: Intent classification with confidence scores
- **System Decision**: Business rules applied and results
- **Action Taken**: Executed operation with reference ID
- **Compliance Record**: Complete audit chain for regulators

**The Audit Triangle**:
```
User Input ‚Üí System Decision ‚Üí Action Taken
     ‚Üì             ‚Üì                ‚Üì
  Recorded    Confidence Log    Transaction ID
```

**Compliance Rules**:
- Minimum confidence for financial operations: 0.85
- Maximum automation for amounts > $10,000: NONE
- Required human confirmation for: Account closure, Large transfers, New payees

## üèõÔ∏è **BANKING-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Multi-Turn Conversation Handling**
Banks need to handle complex, multi-step processes:
```
User: "I want to pay my rent"
System: "How much is your rent?"
User: "$1500" 
System: "Which account should I use?"
User: "Checking"
System: "I'll pay $1500 rent from checking. Confirm?"
```

**The 5 Conversation Patterns**:
1. **Single-turn completion** - "What's my balance?" ‚Üí Answer
2. **Clarification request** - "Transfer money" ‚Üí "How much?"
3. **Disambiguation choice** - "Pay John" ‚Üí "Which John?"
4. **Progressive collection** - Gather missing entities step by step
5. **Confirmation & execute** - "Transfer $500 to John from checking. Confirm?"

### **Context Preservation**
Banking conversations often reference previous actions:
- "Transfer the same amount to Sarah"
- "Block that card I mentioned earlier"
- "Add him as a payee too"

### **Error Recovery & Fallback**
Financial services require robust error handling:
- Network failures during transactions
- LLM timeouts or unavailability  
- Invalid entity combinations
- Business rule violations

## üîÆ **KEY ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES**

### **The Essential Formula**
```
Conversational Banking = 
    (Intent + Entities + Context) √ó Confidence
    √∑ Risk
    + Human Confirmation
    = Deterministic Action
```

### **The Banking Intent Formula**
```
Intent = Category + Action + Risk Level + Auth Requirement
```

### **The Simplicity Paradox**
**Complex Inside, Simple Outside**
- **User sees**: Natural conversation
- **System does**: 50+ validation checks  
- **Regulator sees**: Complete audit trail
- **Developer sees**: Modular components

### **Business Rule Validation in Practice**

**Entity Validation Cascade**:
1. **Format Check**: Is it valid?
2. **Business Rule**: Is it allowed?
3. **Risk Assessment**: Is it safe?

**Real Examples**:

**Format Check**:
```python
# Is "$500" a valid amount?
if not re.match(r'^\$?\d+(\.\d{2})?$', amount_str):
    return "Invalid amount format"

# Is "mom" a valid recipient reference?
if recipient in personal_references:  # ["mom", "dad", "wife", etc.]
    proceed_to_resolution()
```

**Business Rule Check**:
```python
# Daily transfer limits
if daily_transfers + amount > daily_limit:
    return "Daily transfer limit exceeded"

# Account ownership validation
if from_account not in user.owned_accounts:
    return "You don't own this account"

# Recipient verification for large amounts
if amount > 1000 and recipient not in verified_recipients:
    return "Recipient requires verification for amounts > $1000"
```

**Risk Assessment**:
```python
# Velocity checking
if transfer_count_last_hour > 5:
    risk_level = "HIGH"
    
# Pattern detection
if amount == previous_fraud_amount and recipient == previous_fraud_recipient:
    risk_level = "CRITICAL"
    
# Geographic validation
if user_location != usual_location and amount > 5000:
    risk_level = "HIGH"
```

**Why Each Layer Matters**:
- **Format Check**: Prevents system crashes from malformed data
- **Business Rule**: Enforces bank policies and legal requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Protects against fraud and suspicious activity
