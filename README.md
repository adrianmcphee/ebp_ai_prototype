- **[🏗️ System Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Comprehensive technical architecture guide
- **[📖 Quick Start](#-quick-start)** - Get the prototype running locally

## 🎯 Three AI Exploration Areas

### 1. Navigation Assistance
- **Intent-Based Routing**: "Take me to international transfers" → Routes to pre-built wire transfer screen
- **Context-Aware Navigation**: Understanding user intent to navigate to existing EBP interfaces
- **Smart Screen Discovery**: Finding specific banking screens through conversational queries
- **Workflow Guidance**: Direct routing to appropriate pre-assembled banking interfaces

### 2. Transaction Assistance  
- **Dynamic UI Generation**: Builds custom forms based on intent ("Send $500 to Canada" → 4-field form vs 57-field generic)
- **Context-Aware Form Assembly**: Smart field selection, hiding complexity, progressive disclosure
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-populates forms based on user history and transaction context
- **Intent Recognition**: 36 comprehensive banking intents with risk assessment and entity extraction
- **Business Rules Integration**: Balance checks, limits, compliance validation with real-time form adaptation

### 3. MCP Integration for AI Agents
- **Standardized Banking Tools**: 8 core banking operations exposed via MCP protocol
- **AI Assistant Compatibility**: Works with Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, and other MCP clients
- **Shared Intent Architecture**: Same intent classification system across all three use cases
- **Production-Grade Security**: Full risk assessment and authentication for AI-initiated operations

## 🏗️ Technical Capabilities

### Enhanced Intent Classification
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 36 banking intents across 16 categories (Account Management, Payments, Cards, Lending, etc.)
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Banking-specific intents (e.g., `accounts.balance.check`, `payments.transfer.internal`)
- **Hybrid Classification**: LLM-based primary classification with pattern-based fallback
- **Confidence Scoring**: Precision confidence levels (0.0-1.0) with configurable thresholds
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Returns top alternatives when confidence is low

### Smart Entity Extraction & Validation
- **Required vs Optional Entities**: Validates presence of mandatory fields
- **Format Validation**: Regex patterns, value ranges, checksum validation
- **Entity Normalization**: Standardizes phone numbers, dates, amounts
- **Complex Entity Types**: Routing numbers, card identifiers, frequencies

### Context-Aware Response System
- **Precondition Checking**: Balance verification, fraud detection, limit checks
- **Business Rule Engine**: Hours of operation, daily limits, compliance checks
- **Authentication Escalation**: Automatic elevation based on risk level
- **Confirmation Flows**: Two-step verification for high-risk operations

### Multi-Turn Conversation Support
- **Reference Resolution**: Understands "him", "the same amount", "that account"
- **Context Persistence**: Maintains state across conversation turns
- **Missing Information Handling**: Stores context and prompts for required data
- **High-Risk Confirmations**: Waits for explicit approval before execution

## 📋 Supported Banking Operations

### Intent Categories
The system includes **36 comprehensive banking intents** across **16 categories**, covering all standard banking operations from account management to international transfers. Each intent includes risk assessment, authentication requirements, and entity specifications.

**Key Categories:**
- **Account Management** (6 intents) - Balance, statements, alerts, lifecycle
- **Payments & Transfers** (7 intents) - Bill pay, P2P, internal/external transfers  
- **Cards** (5 intents) - Activation, blocking, replacement, PIN, limits
- **Lending & Investments** (6 intents) - Loans, mortgages, trading, portfolios
- **Security & Auth** (4 intents) - Login, password, 2FA
- **Other** (8 intents) - Business banking, international, support, disputes

> **📋 Complete Intent Documentation**: See **[INTENT_SYSTEM.md](INTENT_SYSTEM.md)** for detailed intent specifications, risk levels, entity requirements, and usage examples.

      "args": [
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/ebpnlp/backend/run_mcp_server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LLM_PROVIDER": "mock",
        "REDIS_URL": "mock",
        "DATABASE_URL": "mock"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** and look for the 🔨 hammer icon indicating tools are available

4. **Try Banking Operations:**
```
You: "What's my account balance?"
Claude: [Uses check_account_balance tool] 
Claude: "Your checking account balance is $2,847.32"

You: "Send $100 to my sister Sarah"
Claude: [Uses send_p2p_payment tool]
Claude: "I've sent $100 to Sarah. The payment is processing."
